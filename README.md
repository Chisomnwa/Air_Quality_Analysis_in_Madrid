# Dataset

Authorities in Madrid, Spain have been forced to take critical measures in combating the continuous deterioration of air quality in the city. One of such measures is the prohibition of cars in the city center. The dataset, collected over an 18 year period, can be useful to answer critical questions about the causes, effects and possible solutions to air pollution in Madrid and other parts of the world. See more about the data set here.
 
# Summary of Findings

 - I found out that most of the gaseous pollutants were of the same source which were mainly fuel for cars, buses, trains and airplanes.
 
 - I found out that most of the other pollutants had a strong correlation with CO (Carbon monoxide) and some other pollutants also had a strong positive relationship with NOx (Nitrous oxide). 	So, when these two pollutant gases are tackled by the government of Madrid, they are likey to tackle and reduce the presence of other gases too.
I found out that there is a negative and postive trend of CO nad NOX pollutants measurement in most of the stations as it concerns the measurement variations within the different months in a year, from 2001 to 2018
 
. The measurement decreases from January and becomes constant from March or April up unitil August where it increases till September the next year.
It was observed that CO measurement decreased from 2001 t0 2018 in most of the stations, and was only observed more in stations with low elevation. Example - Mendez Alvaro, Farolillo.
It was observed that NO measurent for most stations decreased from 2001 for some of the stations, and became contant from 2011 till 2016 for most of the stations, before increasing and dropping again in 2017.
So it's generally negative secular trend with random variations in the most of the stations.
NO was also observed at stations with mid to low elevation. Example - Pza. del Carmen, Pza. de España.
Recommendation:
The government of Madrid should restrict the movement of cars in the urban ares especially during the dry or winter season.
More concentration should be given to ares around stations that are located in low elevations.
The government of madrid should communicate its citizens the connection between air quality and public health thereby encouraging the citizens to use more of renewable energy resources, walk short distances instead driving.
The government should also encourage planting of rain gardens and planting of trees at homes, in schools and offices.
